To run this program, one must first be using WinPython, or have the Pandas library.

Then one must run the GenerateHouses and GeneratePeople to create a set of houses and people to be used in HouseMatch.

Once a set of houses and people have been created, the HouseMatch program will create a visual representation of how the attributes of the people match them
to houses.
