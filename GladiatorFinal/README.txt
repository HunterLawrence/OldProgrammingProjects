Gladiator

For Gladiator to properly function, the following must first
be done:
1. Two folders are created in the same directory as all class files
   one named "gameSaveFiles" and the other "opponentFiles".
2. the text files "commoner", "fighter", "gladiator", "grandChampion",
   "knight", and "peasant" must be placed within the previously created
   folder named "opponentFiles".

Instructions:
This game is a hardcore style roguelike. If you die in the Colosseum
that character will no longer be playable. The goal of gladiator
is to defeat the Grand Champion of the Colosseum. This task is
impossible right off the bat, you must train and collect weapons and
armor. of course, neither of these are free, you must fight in
the Colosseum to earn money, this can be made faster by promoting
your fights to increase the amount of gold from each fight.
The available opponents in the Colosseum will range in difficulty
but can be easily overcome with enough training and equipment.

Do you have what it takes to become the new Grand Champion of Gladiator?
